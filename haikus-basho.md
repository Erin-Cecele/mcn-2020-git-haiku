Spring is passing.
The birds cry, and the fishes’ eyes are 
With tears.

The summer grasses.
All that remains
Of warriors’ dreams.

A owner of the old thatched hut
Is also changed to another
It’s the Doll’s Festival.

Oh, tranquility!
Penetrating the very rock,
A cicada’s voice.

The rains of summer join together.
How swift it is
Mogami River.

None is travelling
Here along this way but I,
This autumn evening.

The first day of the year:
thoughts come - and there is loneliness;
the autumn dusk is here.

An old pond
A frog jumps in -
Splash!

Lightning -
Heron's cry
Stabs the darkness

Clouds come from time to time -
and bring to men a chance to rest
from looking at the moon.

In the cicada's cry
There's no sign that can foretell
How soon it must die.

Poverty's child -
he starts to grind the rice,
and gazes at the moon.

Won't you come and see
loneliness? Just one leaf
from the kiri tree.

Temple bells die out.
The fragrant blossoms remain.
A perfect evening!

Now that eyes of hawks
in dusky night
are darkened . . .

White cloud of mist
above white
cherry-blossoms . . .
